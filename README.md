# llm

Monorepo for multiple LLM-assisted projects.

## Rules (mandatory)
- Work happens on `llm/<task>` branches. `main` is protected/human-merged.
- One logical change per commit. No cross-project refactors in a single commit.
- Never commit secrets. If unsure, stop and ask.
- Keep projects isolated under `projects/<name>/`.

## Projects
- `projects/food/`
- `projects/kodikitty/`
- `projects/remindersystem/`

## Contribution workflow (LLM)
See `docs/workflow.md`.
